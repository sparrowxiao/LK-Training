    1. strict mode is being a tool for highlighting any potential problems in your app. it is just a package that's going to activate some additional checks to let you know if your've written any code incorrectly, but these are only going to run in development. They are not going to run in production.
    2. App Component is matched with App.js + App.css
    3. package.json is used for installing all the app dependencies. node_modules will be generated
*Destructuring arrays and objects
    `{props}` --> `{ destructure_name }`
*The useState Hook
     1. is more easier way to destructure the objs, and also can keep code clean and we don't need to set property from outside of the component.
     2. `import {useState} from "react"`
