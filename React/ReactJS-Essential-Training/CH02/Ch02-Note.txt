CDN = Content Delivery Network
src in the head tag has import the the https://unpkg.com.react@17/umd/react.development.js
in this way, it is a quick way to add the react library to your webpage!

Notice: the CDN link is not supported when I practiced the code! So I change it to version @18, works
however the err from console showing I  need to use new method createRoot() is a method from
ReactDOM but createElement() is from React.


A good list example added into the render property showing createElement will make the code hard to
read, so it is time to get the idea of JSX, but the new added syntax is not supported by the browser.
We need to introduce the new thing called Babel.
1. import new CDN resource to use Babel
2. change the text/javascript into text/babel

JSX expression{val_name}
Notice ONLY ONE html tag can be used!
